    /*2 pointer method, cycclic pattern
    in plaace traverSAL
    merge and bubble sort in linked list

    in java array is not a continuos memory location but in genral we state that it is , so if we create an array of size 5 and store value in 6th
    it will give an array

    linked list does not says continous memory location -
    it says to store differnet values in different part of the memoty and let the point each other

     reference variables HEAD & TAIL
     head
